Open Source Robot for Disposal of Explosive Ordnance Research (*O.R.D.E.R.*)

This is a project to create a cheap a [IROBOT Packbot Chassis Replica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PackBot) focusing on toughness, speed, and omni-terrain navigation over surfaces like debree, rocks, and household obstacles like stairs. The initiative will begin with the development of the drive-chain and move up in complexity.

My Current Design Constraints Are:
* Terrain, Movement, and the Outdoors:
  * Speed over asphalt/flat ground ≥ 7.5 meters/second
  * Reliable handling of 1.5 meter falls
  * Tested to achieve [IP67](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_Code) or near toughness meaning no dust ingress or water ingress under one meter for 30 minutes
* Cost and Availability:
  * Two versions maintained (one built to be manufactured with simple tools and 3D printing and one built to be made with less widely available CNC machine tools)
  * Price point for entry level version ≤1000 USD
* Future Support and Customizability:
  * All CAD Published and Customizable
  * Modular and customizable top layout for variety of equipment and tools including cameras and eventually an official robot arm
