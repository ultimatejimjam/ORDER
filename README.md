Opensource Robot for Disposal of Explosive Ordinance Research (O.R.D.E.R.)

This is a project to create a cheap a [IROBOT Packbot Chassis Replica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PackBot) focusing on toughness, speed, and omni-terrain navigation over surfaces like debree, rocks, and household obsticles like stairs. The initiative will begin with the development of the drivechain and move up in complexity.

My Current Design Constraints Are:
-Speed over asphault/flat ground ≥ 7.5 meters/second
-Reliable handling of 1.5 meter falls
-Tested to achieve [IP67](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_Code) or near toughness meaning no dust ingress or water ingress under one meter for 30 minutes
-Two versions maintained (one built to be manufactured with simple tools and 3D printing and one built to be made with less widely available CNC machine tools)
-Price point for entry level version ≤1000 USD
-Modular and customizable top layout for variety of equipment and tools including cameras and eventually an official robot arm.
